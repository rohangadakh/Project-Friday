This is the Project Friday. Which functions similarly to Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft's Cortana. If you plan to utilise this code, you will need to make a few minor adjustments. This project contains one ChatBot code line. To use the ChatBot, create a separate file (ChatBot.py), then import it into this file. You can download the ChatBot.py's source code from my GitHub. Simply comment out the last few lines of the ChatBot code if you do not wish to use the ChatBot feature.
